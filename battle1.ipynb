It has become top choices for local and foreign communities for housing, job employment, education, shopping and tourism. The objective of this report is to study and analyze Queens and Brooklyn neighborhoods of separately and group them into similar clusters and, to analyze those clusters to gather meaningful information. That information can be used to find out similarities and dissimilarities between two boroughs Queens and Brooklyn. Therefore, people can make better decision between the two boroughs on all the great amenities and other types of venues that exist in the neighborhood, such as gourmet fast food joints, pharmacies, parks, graduate schools and so on.\n"

Use Foursquare API to get some information about venues around the neighborhoods. At last, focusing on to find similarities and dissimilarities between two boroughs use machine learning technique, \u201cClustering\u201d to segment the neighborhoods."
